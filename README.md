# Notes and Exercises for "Algorithms" by Jeff Erickson

Since the [original textbook](http://www.algorithms.wtf) does not have a solution manual or answer key, I have taken it upon myself to try to solve as many questions
from the book as possible and post implemented solutions and proofs in IPython.


* Note: not all solutions will be present
  - The book is extensive containing questions with absurd levels of difficulty
  - Some of the proofs in the book are still open questions and unsolved.
