    "### Question 1\n",
    "Prove that the original recursive Tower of Hanoi algorithm performs exactly the same sequence of moves—the same disks, to and from the same pegs, in the same order—as each of the following non-recursive algorithms. The pegs are labeled 0, 1, and 2, and our problem is to move a stack of n disks from peg 0 to peg 2 (as shown on page 24).\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. If n is even, swap pegs 1 and 2. At the ith step, make the only legal move that avoids peg i mod 3. If there is no legal move, then all disks are on peg i mod 3, and the puzzle is solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. For the first move, move disk 1 to peg 1 if n is even and to peg 2 if n is odd. Then repeatedly make the only legal move that involves a different disk from the previous move. If no such move exists, the puzzle is solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. Pretend that disks n+1, n+2, and n+3 are at the bottom of pegs 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Repeatedly make the only legal move that satisfies the following constraints, until no such move is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "       • Do not place an odd disk directly on top of another odd disk. \n",
    "       • Do not place an even disk directly on top of another even disk. • Do not undo the previous move.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    (d) Let ρ(n) denote the smallest integer k such that n/2k is not an integer. For example, ρ(42) = 2, because 42/21 is an integer but 42/22 is not. (Equivalently, ρ(n) is one more than the position of the least significant 1 in the binary representation of n.) Because its behavior resembles the marks on a ruler, ρ(n) is sometimes called the ruler function."
