    "### Question 4\n",
    "Recall that the input to the Huntington-Hill algorithm ApportionCongress is an array Pop[1 .. n], where Pop[i] is the population of the ith state, and an integer R, the total number of representatives to be allotted. The output is an array Rep[1 .. n], where Rep[i] is the number of representatives allotted to the ith state by the algorithm.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Huntington-Hill algorithm is sometimes described in a way that avoids the use of priority queues entirely. The top-level algorithm “guesses” a positive real number D, called the divisor, and then runs the following subroutine to compute an apportionment. The variable q is the ideal quota of representatives    allocated to a state for the given divisor D; the actual number of representatives allocated is always either ⌈q⌉ or ⌊q⌋.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three possibilities for the final return value reps. If reps < R, we did not allocate enough representatives, which (at least intuitively) means our divisor D was too small. If reps > R, we allocated too many representatives, which (at least intuitively) means our divisor D was too large. Finally, if reps = R, we can return the array Rep[1 .. n] as the final apportionment. In practice, we can compute a valid apportionment (with reps = R) by calling HHGuess with a small number of integer divisors close to the standard divisor D = P/R.\n",
    "In the following problems, let P = 􏰕ni=1 Pop[i] denote the total popula- tion of all n states, and assume that n ≤ R ≤ P."
